comments:
 - needs more investigation if burst read support needs more driver updates than this commit
 - patch dropped from BSP5.1 and no test case, make it a maybe-item
 - patch reappeared for BSP6.1, moving back
 - Geert reported that this patch breaks QSPI on Gen3; this needs more investigation
 - this patch is incomplete because it does not handle wrap around (see DRCR register desc)

comments:
 - H3 ES1.* needs many workarounds which become a maintenance burden
 - because it was only available internally, we agreed to remove upstream support for it
 - Wolfram created a series to disable H3 ES1 support in the kernel which will be merged into the BSP
 - this task tracks the upstreaming effort of the above series
 - first item is to upstream the patch which disables booting on H3 ES1
 - after that, the H3 ES1 handling code and workarounds can safely be removed
 - patch to disable booting sent

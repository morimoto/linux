* About BSP rebase

	Upstream team rebases BSP kernel to Linux Kernel v6.1.X.
	Rebased BSP structure is like below.

		(C) xxxxx BSP rebase work on v6.1.X
		 ^  xxxxx ...
		 |  xxxxx local patches which is/will posted to upstream ML
		(B) xxxxx local patches from previous BSP
		 |  xxxxx backported patches from latest Linux
		 v
		(A) xxxxx v6.1.X

	(A) is base kernel (= LTS v6.1.X)
	(B) are BSP additional patches (backport, etc)
	(C) is information from Upstream team.

	(C) is for BSP team, but not for customer.
	Please remove (C) commit when BSP team uses this rebased BSP.
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	(C) is including below

		${LINUX}/renesas-bsp

* About git repository/branch/tag

	You can find BSP rebase repository at

		Github
		https://github.com/renesas-rcar/upstream_bsp

	You can clone it by

		git clone https://github.com/renesas-rcar/upstream_bsp.git

	You can find 2 type of branch/tag

	branch
		(A) renesas-bsp/v6.1-dev
		(B) renesas-bsp/v6.1.xxx-yyyy-mm-dd

	tag
		(A) renesas-dev-v6.1.xxx
		(B) renesas-bsp-v6.1.xxx

	(A) is using "git merge". Pros is you can use "git merge" for it. Cons is it is difficult
	to know what kind of patch was backported from upstream.

	(B) is using "git rebase". Pros is it is easy to know what kind of patch was backported from
	upstream. Cons is you need to use "git rebase" for it, can't use "git merge".

	You can't check/fetch above tag by normal ways.  You need to do...

		> git ls-remote --tags renesas-rcar
		> git fetch renesas-rcar refs/tags/renesas-xxx-v6.1.xxx

* Handled commits / ignored commits

	Upstream team has been trying to upport BSP local patches,
	thus many of these patches are now upstreamed.
	We can categorize previous BSP commits into below

		(1) upstreamed, and included in LTS v6.1.X.
		(2) upstreamed, and included in latest Linux kernel.
		(3) not yet upstreamed.
		(4) ignored.

	We did nothing (1) patches because it is already included on base
	kernel (= LTS v6.1.X).
	We backported (2) patches into this rebased BSP. Each commit has
	"cherry picked from" tag.
	We are trying to upport (3) patches, thus it is not yet included.

	But, we ignored (4) patches, because these are..

		(4.1) BSP specific patch which is not possible to upport
		(4.2) It is not accepable in upstream
		(4.3) It is wrong solution
		(4.4) We don't have the board / can't test

	BSP team need to handle (4) patches by themself.

	You can see which commit was included, which commit was ignored,
	and some comments from Upstream team.
	Please see below

		${LINUX}/renesas-bsp/comment : (1)/(2)/(3)
		${LINUX}/renesas-bsp/handled : (1)/(2)
		${LINUX}/renesas-bsp/remains : (3)
		${LINUX}/renesas-bsp/ignored : (4)

* ignored backport

	Below features has been ignored, because it needs new framework and
	it difficult to backport.

	- Ethernet-TSN
	- PCIe
	- 88Q2110 PHY
	- max96712
	- rcar-csi2 for V4M

* about defconfig

** renesas_defconfig

	Upstream team recommend to defconfig

** rcar_bsp_defconfig

	BSP team handled shrink version of defconfig

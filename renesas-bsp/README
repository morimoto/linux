* Task
	1) Backport/Handle each bsp-remains patches on latest renesas-bsp-rebase-v6.1
	2) Update done/bsp-remain files accordingly
	3) Push it to your git repository, and indicate it. Morimoto will merge it.
	4) back to 1)

* Todo
	Morimoto
		- Add "bsp-only" file for *real* local patch (next week).
		- Create "renesas-dir" dir, and move each files to there (next week).
		- Create "summary" file
		- How to handle V3U patches ?

	Core
		- BSP is using many "ebisu-xxx" dts, but upstream has only "ebisu".
		  We can remove these from "bsp-remains", and explain about it on "done"
		- Let's accept "defconfig" update patch even though it was local patch.

	Shimoda
		- fix done file comment

* About "cherry-pick"

	Let's use it to *reduce* bsp-remains for now,
	not for aggressive backport.

* How to handle *upportable* patch ?

	If the patch can be upstreamed, but is now trying to,
	let's apply the patch, and remove it from bsp-remains.
	The patch can be replaced if the patch was accepted on upstream.

* How to handle *real* local patch ?

	Keep it on "bsp-remains" (will be "bsp-only" file next week),
	and explain about it on "done" file.

	Please find and use last part of "bsp-remains" for now.

	These non-upstreamable commits will be handled by BSP team.

* Schedule

	I could connect to BSP team. The time limit is "End of Feb".
	So we have *3* month.

	~ Nov/E
		- focus "backportable" patches
			- From linus or linux-next branches
		- focus "defconfig update" patches
			- let's accept defconfig update patch even though
			  it was local patch
		- pickup *real* local patch
			- and move it to "end of bsp-remains" file
			  (for now. We will use "bsp-only" file from next week).

	~ Jan/E
		- focus "upportable" patches
			- This means, it is still local patch, but can be upported.
			  Please apply such patch, and remove it from remain file.
			  And try to upport it. We can replace it if upport has done.

	~ Feb/E
		- aggressive backport (if needed)
		- finalize

	Every Friday
		I will ask latest git every Friday, and merge it at next Monday.
		But please don't hesitate to say "did nothing, because of SoW",
		we never complain about it. We don't know when you are working for Renesas.

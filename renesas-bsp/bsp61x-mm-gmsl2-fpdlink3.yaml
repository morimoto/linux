comments:
 - GMSL2 and FPD-Link III support is a large project that needs to be scheduled
   on its own. The V4L2 streams API has been merged upstream, so now would be a
   good time to resume work in this area. Some FPD-Link III serializer and
   deserializer drivers are also close to being merged upstream.

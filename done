		- Upstream is already supporting TDM on ulcb-kf pcm3168a.
		  BSP is assuming that pcm3168a can handle Playback/Capture on same DAI,
		  but it is wrong. pcm3168a is not symmetric device (playback 8ch vs capture 6ch).
		- BSP is naming Sound Card as "ak4613", but it is wrong (2a460a4e95a3).
		  It should be total "sound card name", not "codec name".
		- BSP is using si468x/wl18xx for Sound, but these are not cared,
		  because we don't have these.
		  - BSP try to use si468x/wl18xx on extra Sound card, it is wrong.
		    These should be handled on the existing Card.
		    There is no guarantee on current ALSA SoC to use one driver (CPU)
		    with different Sound Cards.

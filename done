RAVB
	- R-Car V4H BSP patches are included in native 6.1.
	- commit 469ff9d9ba21 in BSP should be upported.
	- Other BSP patches are rejected for upstream.

RPC
	- RPC on R-Car H3/M3-W/M3-N is supported upstream

Sound
	- All BSP local driver patches are included in native v6.1
	- DT
		- Upstream is already supporting TDM on ulcb-kf pcm3168a.
		  BSP is assuming that pcm3168a can handle Playback/Capture on same DAI,
		  but it is wrong. pcm3168a is not symmetric device (playback 8ch vs capture 6ch).
		- BSP is tring to use each codecs as different Sound Card (ak4613/pcm3168a/si468x/wl18xx),
		  but it is wrong. These should be handled on the same Card.
		  Otherwise it will get error, like below
			[    2.533890] rcar_sound ec500000.sound: Trying to bind component to card "pcm3168a" but is already bound to card "ak4613"
			[    2.544950] asoc-audio-graph-card sound@1: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -19
		- BSP is using si468x/wl18xx for Sound, but these are not cared,
		  because upstream team don't have these.

UFS:
	- commit 263922789924 in BSP is included in native v6.1.
	- commit 96cea6157e17 in BSP is upportable, but as mentioned commit
	  261c8a8138c3 in BSP, it needs "many I2C commaands". (RC21012 driver.)

	- DT
		- Upstream is already supporting TDM on ulcb-kf pcm3168a.
		  BSP is assuming that pcm3168a can handle Playback/Capture on same DAI,
		  but it is wrong. pcm3168a is not symmetric device (playback 8ch vs capture 6ch).
		- BSP is tring to use each codecs as different Sound Card (ak4613/pcm3168a/si468x/wl18xx),
		  but it is wrong. These should be handled on the same Card.
		  Otherwise it will get error, like below
			[    2.533890] rcar_sound ec500000.sound: Trying to bind component to card "pcm3168a" but is already bound to card "ak4613"
			[    2.544950] asoc-audio-graph-card sound@1: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -19
		- BSP is using si468x/wl18xx for Sound, but these are not cared,
		  because upstream team don't have these.
